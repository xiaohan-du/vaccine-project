## Security
When dealing with SQL commands in a project, multiple security measures need to be placed to ensure security. These includes physical measures, OS firewall, encryption, SQL injection prevention etc.

## Stability
The SQL script should run without error for the testing data, then larger set of data can be implemented and no error should be shown either. 

## Capacity
Storage and disk capacity are important factors when designing a database project. Utilise capacity planning is an effective measure to optimise capacity. Current data usage can also be used proactively to predict future workload.

## Compatibility
The database (MySQL) version used in this project is 10.6.3. However, no backwards compatibility was considered when implementing the project. 

## Reliability and Availability
Database reliability includes data accuracy, safety, recoverability. MySQL Workbench provides a certain level of recoverability for SQL scripts. The database should be backed up regularly to ensure that if lost, it can be recovered. The database should be available whenever needed. 

## Maintainability  + Manageability
The SQL scripts were written in a way to ensure easy access and modification. All stored procesures and functions were well commented to help future users to understand.

## Scalability
The project were designed to be scalable. The code should be able to handle the workload when extra work is added. 

## Usability
The SQL scripts were well documented to ensure it's user-friendly.
